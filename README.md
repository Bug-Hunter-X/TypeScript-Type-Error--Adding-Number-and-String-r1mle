# TypeScript Type Error: Adding Number and String

This example demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript when performing arithmetic operations with incompatible types.

The `add` function is explicitly typed to accept two numbers and return a number. However, the code attempts to call it with a number and a string, resulting in a type error.

The solution demonstrates how to improve type safety by explicitly checking the types of the inputs or using type guards.
